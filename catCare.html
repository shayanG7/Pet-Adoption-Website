        <h2> Cat Care - A General Guideline to Follow <a href="https://bettervet.com/resources/pet-health-care/how-to-take-care-of-a-cat"> (via BetterVet.com) </a></h2>

                <h3>Feeding/Hydrating Your Cat</h3>
                A cat's natural diet includes prey, such as rodents, birds, insects, and lizards, which provide high protein, minimal carbohydrates, and low fat. Cats are obligate carnivores and require taurine, which is found in animal-based proteins. Taurine deficiency causes serious health problems.<br><br>
                Provide a constant supply of fresh water, even if you rarely see your cat drink, and keep treats to no more than 5% of their diet.<br><br>
                If your cat isn't eating or you're not sure they're eating enough (or too much), schedule a veterinary visit so a qualified veterinarian can evaluate your cat and recommend an appropriate diet for your feline friend.<br><br>

            <p>
                <h3>Proper Housing</h3>
                Your cat needs a clean, comfortable place to rest and sleep. Create a safe hiding space in a corner or closet where they can rest and sleep uninterrupted. Cats love elevated spaces, so providing shelves or cat trees is a good environmental enrichment that'll give them security and a great vantage point.<br><br>
                Cats also love clean spaces, so clean their bedding and sleeping areas regularly and ensure the sleeping area is far from the litter box to maintain hygiene and reduce odors.<br><br>
            <!-- </p> -->
            <br>
            <p>
                <h3>Scratching Needs</h3>
                Scratching helps cats maintain their claws, stretch muscles, and flex their joints. It's normal, healthy behavior, and cats don't sink their claws into your sofa to annoy you.<br><br>
                Providing your cat with a sturdy scratching post or a scratching board or pad will prevent them from ruining your furniture or carpets. They're inexpensive, depending on the type, and you can even make your own from scrap wood and natural fiber rope or corrugated cardboard.<br><br>
            <!-- </p> -->
            <br>
            <p>
                <h3>Regular Grooming</h3>
                Although cats groom themselves, they need extra help to keep them healthy. Essential grooming tips include brushing hair, bathing, trimming nails, dental care, and removing ear wax.
