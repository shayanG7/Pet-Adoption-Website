        <h2> Dog Care - A General Guideline to Follow <a href="https://bettervet.com/resources/pet-health-care/how-to-take-care-of-a-dog"> (via BetterVet.com) </a></h2>

            <h3>Feeding Your Dog</h3>
                <strong>Puppies:</strong> Feed your puppy a well-balanced diet that has the proper nutrients to support a fast-growing puppy. Ensure you feed them three times a day. If you are unsure of the best puppy food for your dog's breed, consult your veterinarian.<br><br>
                <strong>Adults:</strong> The type and amount of food your adult dog needs depends on their size and activity level. Different commercial diets can also offer different benefits, such as skin care or diets for sensitive stomachs.<br><br>
                <strong>Seniors:</strong> A senior dog's diet may contain more high-quality proteins to fuel and maintain muscle mass but lower calories to account for less activity.  It is important for a healthy balance of fat, proteins, sodium, and phosphorus. Some senior dogs may benefit from feeding them smaller portions more frequently throughout the day.  This is also a good way to monitor their water intake in order to ensure proper hydration.<br><br>

            <h3>Excercise Needs</h3>
            Pet parents should ensure their dogs exercise regularly, between 30 minutes and two hours daily. Play fetch, go for walks, make a dog obstacle course, and play indoor games for mental stimulation. Let them exercise more if you have active or working breeds, but less exercise will be ideal if you have for example, a toy breed.<br><br>

        <p>
            <h3>Grooming Your Dog</h3>
            Brush their fur to reduce shedding, remove dead skin, distribute its natural oils, and allow air circulation throughout the coat.<br><br>
            Brush their teeth to prevent oral problems.<br><br>
            Trim their nails to prevent nails from growing back into the paw pads, causing pain and even making your dog limp. Nail trimming also protects your furniture and floors from dog scratches.<br><br>
            Depending on their type of hair coat, bathe them on a regular basis to remove visible dirt, and keep them healthy and free from parasites.<br><br>
